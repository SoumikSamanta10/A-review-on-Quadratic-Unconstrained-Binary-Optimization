# **A review on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization**
## **Womenium Global Quantum program** 


The project [report](https://github.com/SoumikSamanta10/QUBO-Ising-Quantum_Annealing/blob/8586c7dc33db1c7850365fae7830218376450dfe/A%20Review%20on%20QUBO%2C%20Ising%20model%2C%20Quantum%20Annealing.pdf) in the folder `Report'.

## **Project Description:**

The Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is well-known class of Combinatorial optimization problems with applications ranging from economics and computer science to pure mathematics. In this report, we explored the connection and equivalence of these QUBO problems with certain mathematical model called the Ising model, named after Ernst Ising is used in statistical mechanics to describe ferromagnetism. As QUBO problems mainly belong to the NP-Hard category in terms of computational complexity, getting exact solutions with reasonable efficiency becomes a hefty task for classical computers. This is where the connection to the Ising model becomes fruitful as it opens a bridge to encode QUBOs into physical systems capable of yielding Heuristic solutions to the problem. We also explore how Adiabatic Quantum Computing and Quantum Annealing are used to develop heuristic solutions and the difference these systems have from the classical approach. At the end of the report, we have simulated a set of three problems - Maximum Cut, Minimum Vertex Cover and Travelling Salesman Problem and solved them with the help of D-Wave systems’ Quantum Annealers.

## **Key Results:**
•	Explored the connection and equivalence of these QUBO problems with the Ising model.
•	Discussed Adiabatic Quantum Computing and Quantum Annealing to develop heuristic solutions and the difference these systems from the classical approach.
•	Simulated a set of three problems - Maximum Cut, Minimum Vertex Cover and Travelling Salesman Problem and solved them with the help of D-Wave systems’ Quantum Annealers.


## **Code Repo Descriptions:**
1) This is a repo created to store/enlist all the codes My team and I created and used for our project.
2) This repo consists of four files, namely QUBO_test, MVC, Max_cut and TSP on simulation of Maximum Cut, Minimum Vertex Cover and Travelling Salesman Problem and solved them with the help of D-Wave systems’ Quantum Annealers.
3) These files cannot be run as it is. To run these files you need to create an account with the DWave leap, go here -> https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/login/
Create and empty workspace and copy-paste/upload the files onto the workspace. Running the files after that should do the job.
