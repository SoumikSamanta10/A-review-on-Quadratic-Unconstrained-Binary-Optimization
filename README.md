# QUBO-Ising-Quantum_Annealing
This is a repo created to store/enlist all the codes My team and I created and used for our project.
This repo consists of four files, namely QUBO_test, MVC, Max_cut and TSP.
These files cannot be run as it is.
To run these files you need to create an account with the DWave leap, go here -> https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/login/
Create and empty workspace and copy-paste/upload the files onto the workspace. Running the files after that should do the job.
